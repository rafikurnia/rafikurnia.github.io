Today I spent most of my time (other than working at the office) to enhance my GitHub page.
<!--more-->

I added a [custom 404 page](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/custom-404-page/), added an automatic sitemap generator using [jekyll/jekyll-sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap), also the most time consuming activity was adding bunch of information to enhance this page's discoverability by utilizing [jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/).

I find this exercise is very interesting. Surely I can discover new knowledge by exploring, configuring, and tweaking an unknown technology.

I wish I can share more like "tutorial" rather than just tell a random story like this.  
Okay maybe next time haha

Have a good night!
