In early days, GitHub Actions supports HCL format, but it was deprecated. GitHub deprecated it on Sep 30. Here is the announcement from [https://developer.github.com/actions/](https://developer.github.com/actions/)

> The documentation at [https://developer.github.com/actions](https://developer.github.com/actions) and support for the HCL syntax in GitHub Actions will be deprecated on September 30, 2019. Documentation for the new limited public beta using the YAML syntax is available on [https://help.github.com](https://help.github.com). See "Automating your workflow with GitHub Actions" for documentation using the YAML syntax.

Now the only supported syntax is in YAML format. To learn more about it, you can read this page: [https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions)
