Have you ever heard about CI/CD before?  
<!--more-->
Yeah! That thing when you push your code to your repository then suddenly some kind of magic is happening,  
and you realize the magic automatically test your code and deploy it to the production.

Well.. Obviously it is not a magic.

When I first read about [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) I think it is somewhat similar to **`tools for CI/CD`**.  
With GitHub Actions:
- You can define one or more workflows for a repository
- In each workflow you can define an event that can trigger it to start
- In the workflow you can also define one or more sequential actions that should be executed.

<!-- What are the events which currently supported? Here is [the answer](https://developer.github.com/actions/managing-workflows/workflow-configuration-options/#events-supported-in-workflow-files)!

I said earlier that it is similar to CI/CD tools, but actually it is not limited to that.  
Basically you can do anything. You can do any actions that you want.

That is all for today!
Thanks for reading!

Will continue in the next post ;)
