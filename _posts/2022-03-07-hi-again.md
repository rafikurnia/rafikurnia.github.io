Hi again!
<!--more-->

Since the last time I wrote something on this page, many things have happened.

Somehow now I am in the middle of working on my Master's thesis. The topic is closely related to the computer network and cloud computing. Not something that I imagined before. Well, I guess that's life.

By the way, I will put the location where I write each post at the bottom starting from now. So that it looks cooler, LOL.

Espoo, Finland<br>
Rafi
